 Version: 1.0.0
 Changes: None.
 Goal: Clear the stream until EOF or \n.
 Params: #1 stream: stream to clear.
 Modifications: Changes stream status.
 Return: -1 if stream is NULL, 1 otherwise.
 Comment: None.

 Version: 1.0.0
 Changes: None.
 Goal: Read a string from the input.
 Params: #1 str: str to store the result.

        #3 stream: stream to read from.
 Modifications: str if input success, stream status.
 Return: -1 if params are NULL or len less than 1.
          0 if read fails (nothing in buffer)
          2 if \n not found. Buffer is cleared.
          1 if read success, \n found.
 Comment: Different return values.

 Version: 1.0.1
 Changes: 1.0.1: added SpaceClear.
 Goal: Read a *type* from the input.
 Params: #1 number: number to store the result.
        #2? base: base of the string input.
        #3 stream: stream to read from.
 Modifications: number to store the result (defaults to 0 if error), stream status.
 Return: -1 if params are NULL, -2 if read fails (nothing in buffer) or too large, 1 if success.
 Comment: Please keep them in sync! The unsigned versions dont compare number with a min, since the min is 0. INPUTSIZE_INT is currently 64. double64 is (in bit) 1 sign, 11 exp, 52 num. INPUTSIZE_FLT is currently 128.
